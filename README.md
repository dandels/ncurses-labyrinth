# About
This is an ncurses game where you direct your cursor through a labyrinth, with the added twist that the characters <, >, v, and ^ can only be traversed in the direction which they point towards.

This is the first non-trivial program I've written in C, based on an idea implemented on paper years ago. 

There are still a lot of bugs in it, but the first level is playable.

# Installation
* Clone the repository
* Run "make"
* Launch the game with "./labyrinth"

# Uninstallation
